# StatChek

  

Instantly find players and organize them into custom Cheks you can revisit anytime.

  

## Overview

How many times have you blanked mid-debate trying to recall your own "Top 10" list? Sports fans constantly create mental rankings but have nowhere to save them properly.

Whether you're debating at a bar, in a group chat, or writing online, your curated takes on players, teams, and eras are just a tap away—transforming scattered opinions into organized, retrievable knowledge.
